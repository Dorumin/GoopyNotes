Electron + React + TypeScript boilerplate

Simpler-is-better setup with webpack + babel.

The app itself is just a counter hooked up with redux and a global error boundary which is nice to have anyway

Developer facilities include reloading the electron window on save, React and Redux DevTools, a mirror server on `localhost:3000`, and the simple `yarn dev`
