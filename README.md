# ReWiki
A three-column automated page editing tool for MediaWiki instances.

The first column is a page generator. You choose a generator, optionally a few filters, and let it generate a list of pages.

The second column is a transformation list. You can choose, customize, and create transforms to process the page's content before publishing.

The third column is a preview of changes and status view.
